# Battleship
A game of battleship from codecademy. I've done my extra credit and have made the game a little extra:

- There are 3 ships. A 3 space horizontal one, a 3 space vertical one, and a 5 space horizontal one.
- The board has been upgraded to 8 spaces
- There is a hit counter to make sure you can still win (and a strike system so you can still lose!)
- Added a system to check if you already hit a ship, or if you guessed off the board.
- Added a system that will show you which ships you sunk (Will show up as D for destroyed!)
- Give it a try! If you find something wrong with it, tell me!

If you do not have a compiler, go to the following website and press "CTRL + Enter" to try the game out!
